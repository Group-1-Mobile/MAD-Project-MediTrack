# MediTracker - Medical Adherence App

This is our group project for the Mobile Application Development course. The main goal of this app is to help people remember to take their medicine on time.

## Group Members & Responsibilities
We divided the work into 5 parts so everyone contributed:
*   **Database**: Handling SQLite Room database to save medicines and history.
*   **Authentication**: Login, Register and Welcome screens using Shared Preferences.
*   **Main Dashboard**: The main screen where you see today's progress and calendar (Main Activity).
*   **Medicine Management**: Adding and editing medicines with Alarm Manager settings.
*   **Reports & Profile**: The history screen to see past records and user profile settings.

## Features We Built
1.  **Add Medicine**: You can save medicine name, dosage, and set a time for reminder.
2.  **Reminders**: The app sends a notification when it is time to take medicine.
3.  ** Dashboard**: Shows a progress bar for how many medicines you took today.
4.  **Calendar**: You can click on top calendar to check past dates.
5.  **History**: Shows a list of all successful doses.
6.  **Offline Support**: The app works without internet because we use local database.

## How to Run
1.  Open Android Studio.
2.  Import our project folder.
3.  Wait for Gradle to sync (it might take some time).
4.  Run on Emulator or Real Device.
