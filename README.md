# 🩺 MediTrack – "Stay on schedule, stay healthy — never miss a dose again."

## 📱 Project Description

**MediTrack** is a mobile application designed to help individuals reliably track their medication schedules, doses, and adherence. It aims to reduce missed doses and medication errors by providing clear reminders, an easy-to-use medication log, and simple progress reports — all while working completely offline.

Built for the **Mobile Application Development Course**, MediTrack demonstrates practical mobile app concepts such as UI/UX design, local data persistence (SQLite), notification scheduling, and basic authentication.  
By empowering users to take medications on time, the app promotes better health outcomes and reduces the burden on patients and caregivers.
